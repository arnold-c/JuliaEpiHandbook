        "Some languages use a different convention, such as `package::function()` in R, but I will use the `package.function()` syntax listed above as this is how you would use a function in Julia.\n",
        "- **keywords** will be used to highlight keywords and phrases, e.g., **Git** or **GitHub**.\n",
        "    - **actions** will also be highlighted in this way, e.g., **commits** or **pushed** being the result of the code `git commit` or `git push` \n",
        "- ***files*** will be used to highlight file names, e.g., ***README.md*** or ***LICENSE***.\n",
