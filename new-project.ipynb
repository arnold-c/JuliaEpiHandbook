        "Above providing us with a useful project structure, `DrWatson` also provides us with a number of very helpful functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For one, it provides us with the `quickactivate()` function that allows us to activate our project and environment when we're working in a script, so we can easily import all the packages we need, regardless of where the script is saved.\n",
        "This means that we don't need to worry about activating our project in the REPL before we start working in a script.\n",
        "This may not sound meaningful, but it's very easy to forget to activate your project in the REPL before you start working in a script, and then you end up with a bunch of errors because you haven't actually imported the packages you need.\n",
        "To use this, make sure your first two lines of your script are always:\n",
        "\n",
        "```julia\n",
        "using DrWatson\n",
        "quickactivate(\"MyFirstProject\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "And secondly, it provides us with convenient directory paths to the folders in our project.\n",
        "For example, if we want to access the `data` folder in our project, we can use the `datadir()` function, which will return the path to the `data` folder.\n",
        "Similarly, if we wanted to save a plot to the `plots` folder, we could use `save(plotsdir(\"plot_object.png\"), plot_object)` function to save the plot in `plot_object` to the `plots` folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "More details about the `DrWatson` project structure and associated functions can be found [here](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/project/).\n",
