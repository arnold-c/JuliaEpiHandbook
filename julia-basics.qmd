# Julia Basics {.unnumbered}

## Key Terms

- **REPL**: The Julia REPL is the Julia Read-Eval-Print-Loop.
    This is the interactive command line interface for Julia.
    When you start Julia in the command line (terminal in Mac/Linux, command prompt in Windows), you are in the REPL, and it is a common way to interact with Julia.
- **Package**: A package is a collection of code that can be used to extend the functionality of Julia and complete specific tasks.
    Packages are installed using the `Pkg` package manager.
- **Object**: An object is anything that you can create using code.
    This may be as simple as a number or a sentence (a string object), or as complex as a model or a plot.
- **Function**: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
    Functions are called by name and can take arguments, before completing some computation and returning a value or object.
    Sometimes functions are written and called for their side effects, i.e. they do not directly return an object, but instead perform some action.
- **Method**: A method is a specific implementation of a function.
- **Multiple Dispatch**: Multiple dispatch is a really exciting feature of Julia, but also one that is more difficult to understand for newer programmers.
    The basic premise is that in Julia, how functions behave depends on the types of the arguments that are passed to them.
    For example, the `*` operator (function) will behave differently if you try to multiply two integers, two floats (numbers with decimals), two matrices, any combination of these etc.
    Each of these different behaviors is a different method of the `*` function.
