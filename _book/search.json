Most people in epidemiology and statistics use R, Stata, or SAS. There are still plenty of people who exclusively use Excel to great results. That’s OK, and I’m not trying to tell you that those options are bad and you should convert to Julia immediately. But there are some advantages that I think make it an attractive option for epidemiologists to consider.",

    "text": "Who Is This For & Pre-Requisite Knowledge?\nBecause this book aims to provide ground-up instruction on using Julia as an epidemiologist, it does not assume any prior coding experience. Many people get started with Excel analysis, and this book tries to provide a new path that will be easier and more reliable for those individuals moving forward. As a result, the earlier chapters will lay out fundamental concepts of Julia and best practices for setting up a project, including concepts on version control and Git. But if you’ve got experience with R (or another language), then I hope to try and draw parallels and examples that will help speed up your learning.\nThe purpose of this book is not to teach you how to write the most performant code, though we will cover some key concepts as we go along, nor show you ever way to do a particular task. Neither is it’s purpose to teach you to become a Julia developer. There are many other resources that are better suited for those purposes, and I’ve tried to include links where appropriate. Instead, the goal is to help you get started with Julia, working through problems that you might encounter in your day-to-day work, providing you with the tools to carry out your work as an epidemiologist, and sufficient Julia knowledge to know how to research and think your way through other obstacles you may encounter. As a result, this book will make choices that prioritize readability and reproducibility over performance, because they are more important when you are getting started. Unlike Python, which takes the approach that there should only be one obvious way to complete a task, Julia provides the user with more flexibility because it is so fast that there are often multiple solutions that are similarly performant, and which one to use comes down to a stylistic choice. Where I make a deliberate choice, I will try to explain why I made that choice, and refer you to alternative approaches that you can explore on your own as you become more proficient with computational epidemiology and Julia.\nNot only will this book help you learn how to use Julia, but I hope that it will also help teach you how to think about problems that are relevant to you in a way that will help you solve them in Julia. Like everything in life, you will not be great at this immediately, and you may even be slower at problem solving with Julia that you are with your current tool. But, with practice, you will get better and faster, and you will soon be able to solve problems that you could not have solved before!",

Julia is a relatively new free programming language that was first released in 2012 by some computational scientists at MIT, and has been growing in popularity ever since. It’s a general purpose language, meaning that it can be used for pretty much anything, but it’s particularly well suited for scientific computing, and is often compared to R, Python, and Matlab. There are plenty of reasons why you might want to learn Julia, but the main ones are that it’s fast, easy to learn (as far as coding goes), and has a great community. And with that, let’s dive in to the benefits and drawbacks of Julia!"

    "section": "Motivation",
    "text": "Motivation\n\nWhy write a book for Julia?\nWhat’s wrong with R, or Stata, or Python, or (insert your favourite language here)?\n\nExcellent questions. I use R every day and think it’s a great language for epidemiology, statistics, visualization, and many more things. But it’s not exactly a fast language. And for me, and plenty more epidemiologists, that can be a problem when working with large data sets or running simulations. Large data is less of an issue because package developers often have already rewritten the core code in a faster language, typically C++. But this is less that ideal if you want to look under the hood as it requires you to learn a second language (and C++ isn’t exactly known for being friendly to newcomers). The bigger issues, though, come when you need to write something from scratch, such as creating a large and complex simulation model, R is sometimes just too slow to actually run on your laptop in a reasonable time period, breaking up the development workflow. In this instance, you have two options: 1) suck it up and just hope your first attempt at the code was correct and don’t need to change anything, or 2) learn and rewrite your slow code in something faster. This is the classic “2 language problem”, and there are plenty of excellent articles on this, such as this Nature Methods article about Julia for Biologists, and this blog post from the creators of Julia.\n\nOK, but not everyone needs to run big simulations or work with big data. Why learn Julia over R in that case?\n\nAnother good question that covers a decent chunk of working epidemiologists. If you don’t need performance, I think it’s a slightly less compelling case, but there are still plenty of good reasons to think about learning Julia.\nFirstly, it has an excellent syntax and design structure that makes it one of the easier (and fun!) languages out there to learn. It’s incredibly helpful to be able to think in plain language and pretty much just implement that in code - for loops are quick so you don’t need to do mental gymnastics to think about how to vectorize your code. I know that’s a jargony term that might not mean anything to you, but in slower languages, you have to think about more abstract and unintuitive ways of implementing what you want, whereas much of your instincts are idiomatic in Julia i.e. are a fast and preferred implentation. This means that you can do more things more easily in Julia than you could in R, which has shoehorned many capabilities into it with varying degrees of success. Metaprogramming and multiple-dispatch are killer features that are core to how Julia works, and will eventually allow you to write simple and interpretable code that would require tons of if statements that result in hard-to-read code in other languages, such as R. And the package manager is excellent, making it so easy to create fully reproducible code, whereas R and Python almost seem to be it intentionally hard to do.\nSecondly, and this is a pretty big one, but Julia is a general purpose language whose syntax is rather similar to Python a lot of the time. Whether we like it or not, Python isn’t going anywhere. There’s a decent chance that at some point you will come across some Python code, or maybe even need to write some for a collaboration, and knowing Julia will make it pretty simple to pick up the key points, without needing to rely on using slow Python in your day-to-day life.\nFinally, if you need it, Julia is first-rate when it comes to scientific computing. A lot of aspects of epidemiology rely on differential equations, math, and increasingly, machine learning. Not only is there the excellent SciML ecosystem that houses a huge collection of state-of-the-art ODE solvers, but also, because Unicode symbols are valid code in Julia, you can literally write mathematical equations that you lifted out of a paper or book, and there’s a decent chance it’ll run with only minor modifications!",

    "text": "It Can’t All Be Sunshine and Roses\nCorrect. Julia is by no means perfect, and you will have to decide if the benefits outweigh the tradeoffs (I believe they do for a lot of us)!\nFirstly, while Julia has an active, friendly, and very enthusiatic community that is often willing to help when you get stuck, it is a relatively new language so support will be more limited than can be found in others. Related to this, not everything you will want to do will have a perfect pre-built package ready to go. Most of the time, this actually isn’t too big a deal as it’s either simple enough that you can quickly figure it out, or complex enough that you probably want to have ownership over the implementation, but occassionally it is genuinely an issue. Both of these issues, however, are improving rapidly as the Julia userbase grows and more people share their questions, expertise, and even turning solutions into packages that can be shared!\nThe next common stumbling block is related to performance. Despite what I said about it being a very fast language, it’s quite a bit slower at the start of a session than R or Python, for example. This is known as the “Time to first X” (TTFX) problem, and while everything will be almost instantaneous the second time you run it, it can be annoying. Thankfully, with the recent release of Julia 1.9.0, this is effectively a problem of the past, with most Julia sessions loading packages and creating your first plot within a few seconds, not a minute.\nAnd the last main issue with Julia is that packages aren’t always documented as clearly as in other languages, and debugging can be a painful experience. Every package is different, and while the Documenter.jl package does an excellent job of standardizing package documentation, unfortuately not everyone does a great job of writing robust tests and guides to help the user. Sometimes you just need to dig in the weeds to figure something out.\nBut, that’s part of the motivation for writing this book. For a lot of what we do as epidemiologists, we can work with very established packages that have solid code bases, so we won’t need to worry too much about the code quality as it’s already been tested by thousands of individuals. Instead, this book is to help guide someone new to Julia through the core tasks of epidemiology, and show you how to use the tools that exist in the community, but may have confusing documentation to someone new to the language, or even programming in general.",

    "text": "Installing Julia\nThe first step to using Julia is to install it on your computer. There are a couple of different methods you can use to do this. The easiest way to get started is to directly download the latest stable Julia release from https://julialang.org/downloads/. This will get you up and running, but will be a bit more difficult to manage in the long run when you want to update Julia to newer versions.\nIf you are willing to put a tiny bit more effort in to save yourself time later, I would strongly recommend installing Julia using the Juliaup tool. This is a small cross-platform installer that can install Julia, as well as manage multiple versions on your computer, which is incredibly helpful when you want to update to a newer Julia version, or test out a new release candidate without breaking your existing Julia installation. You can find the full instructions here: https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup, but in brief, install Juliaup, and then run the following command in your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows):\njuliaup add release # Installs the latest stable release\njuliaup default release # Not necessary with only one installed version, but sets the latest stable release as the default Julia version\nTo test that Julia has been installed correctly, open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) and type julia. If Julia has been installed correctly, you should see something like the following:\n\n\n\nThe Julia REPL\n\n\nIf so, congratulations, you have successfully installed Julia, and you are now in the REPL. You could start working on Julia from here, but we’ll take a quick detour to install VSCode, which will make your life a lot easier. To quit the REPL, type exit() and press enter. You can also type Ctrl + D to exit the REPL.\n\nTrouble Shooting\nIf your Julia installation could not be found, it is likely an issue with your PATH variable. This is a variable that tells your computer where to look for programs when you type them into the command line. If you used Juliaup to install Julia and you are using a Mac or Linux, you might need to add the following line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file, depending of whether your computer uses bash or zsh.\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.juliaup/bin/:$PATH\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you don’t know if your computer is using bash or zsh, you can check by typing echo $SHELL into the command line. This will print the shell that your computer is using; in my case /bin/zsh. You should also type ls -a ~ into the command line to see if you have an existing .bashrc or .zshrc file. If you do not have either, you can create the one relevant to your computer by typing touch ~/.bashrc or touch ~/.zshrc.\n\n\nIf you are using Juliaup on Windows, and installed using the recommended pathways (Windows store or winget command), you will need to edit your PATH variable using the following the steps detailed here, and make sure you have the following path:\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps",

You can download VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Once you have VSCode installed, you will need to install the Julia extension. You can do this by opening this link and clicking “Install”, which will redirect you to VSCode to finish the install process. Alternatively, you can open VSCode, click the extensions icon in the left sidebar of VSCode (the one that looks like 4 blocks), and search for “Julia”.\n\n\n\nVSCode Julia Extension\n\n\nOnce you have installed the Julia extension, you’re ready to start writing Julia code!\nThe first thing you should do is open a Julia REPL within VSCode. To do this, open the VSCode command palette and type “Julia: Start REPL”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe command palette is a really useful feature of VSCode that allows you to search for and run any command available in VSCode.

On Mac or Linux, you can do this by typing which julia into the terminal. On Windows, you can do this by typing where julia into the command prompt.\nIf you installed Julia using Juliaup, you should see something like the following:\n$ which julia\n\n/Users/username/.juliaup/bin/julia\nTake the output of this command and paste it into the VSCode settings. To do this, open the VSCode settings by clicking on the cog icon in the bottom left of the VSCode window, and then clicking “Settings”, or by using the command palette to navigate to “Preferences: Open Settings (UI)”.

Now’s let’s get familiar with VSCode itself, that way we can focus on learning Julia in the rest of the book, rather than getting stuck on the editor.\nA detailed description of the VSCode user interface is beyond the scope of this book (more details can be found here), but there are a few key features that you should be aware of.\n\n\nVideo\nVSCode User Interface\n\n\nAs you can see in the clip above, it is possible to move the main editing blocks around so you can have multiple files open at once (or even multiple views of the same file at different lines of code). Typically, I like to have my code open in one editing block and have the plots display to the right side of the screen.\nTo the left of the editing blocks is the primary sidebar, which contains a number of different panels. The first one, which I have open, is the “Explorer” panel, which shows the files and folders in the current Workspace. A Workspace in VSCode is a collection of folders and files that you want to group together into one project. This is a really useful feature of VSCode as it allows you to also have Workspace-specific settings, which can be useful when working on different projects. To get started with a new Workspace, all you have to do is open a folder in VSCode, as typically it’s a good rule of thumb to have one overarching folder per project. You can do this with Cmd + O on Mac or Ctrl + O on Windows or Linux, or by clicking “File” in the top left of the VSCode window and then clicking “Open Folder”. After doing so, you will see the folder name appear in the top of the “Explorer” panel, with all contained files and folders displayed below.\nFurther down in the sidebar, you will see there is a logo with three circles (which I click on in the video). This is the Julia extension, and will show you the Julia Workspace at the top, which contains every object that you have run and created. Below that is the Documentation section, which is where can search for and view the documentation for any Julia function or type (as long as the function is within one of the packages you have loaded). Finally, below that is the Plot Navigator section, which is where you can view the list of plots that you have created in Julia, and clicking on a plot number will update the plot viewer appropriately.\nAt the bottom of the screen, you will see the Integrated Terminal panel, which is where you can run Julia code, as well as the Problems panel, which will show you any errors or warnings that VSCode has detected in your code. Some other tools can be seen here, but they are not particularly important for now.\nFinally, at the very bottom of the screen is the Status Bar, which shows you the current branch of your git repository (if you have one), the current Julia environment, and some other miscellaneous information.\nOne thing you may have noticed in the video is that I used the keyboard shortcut Cmd + P to open different files within my Workspace. This is a really useful shortcut that allows you to quickly navigate to files, but you can also use it to navigate within a file. Typing @ will allow you to navigate to different symbols e.g. functions, variables, headings etc., and typing : will allow you to navigate to a specific line number in the file.",

Ligatures are special characters that are used to combine multiple characters into one. For example, ==&gt; is a ligature that with particular fonts will be rendered as a double arrow ⟹, which can look nicer and be easier to read. Examples of Unicode characters are Greek letters, such as θ, β, γ, σ, δ etc., which are often used in mathematical notation, and because Julia supports Unicode characters, you can use them in your code! This is very useful when coding up some mathematical formulae, as you can use the actual symbols rather than having to write out the name of the symbol (though this is not always recommended as it can make your code harder to read to those unfamiliar with the formulae). If you would like to use Unicode characters in your Julia code (this won’t necessarily work in other non-Julia files), you can start typing with \\, before typing the name of the symbol you want to use, and then pressing Tab to complete the symbol. For example, to add the θ symbol, you would type \\theta and then press Tab to complete the symbol.\nAll this being said, JuliaMono is a font designed specifically for Julia, and is a great choice for writing Julia code.

When you start Julia in the command line (terminal in Mac/Linux, command prompt in Windows), you are in the REPL, and it is a common way to interact with Julia.\nPackage: A package is a collection of code that can be used to extend the functionality of Julia and complete specific tasks. Packages are installed using the Pkg package manager.\nVariable: A variable is a value or object that you have assigned a name. This may be as simple as a number or a sentence (a string variable), or as complex as a model or a plot.\nFunction: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are called by name and can take arguments, before completing some computation and returning a value or object. Sometimes functions are written and called for their side effects, i.e. they do not directly return an object, but instead perform some action.\nMethod: A method is a specific implementation of a function.\nMultiple Dispatch: Multiple dispatch is a really exciting feature of Julia, but also one that is more difficult to understand for newer programmers. The basic premise is that in Julia, how functions behave depends on the types of the arguments that are passed to them. For example, the * operator (function) will behave differently if you try to multiply two integers (whole numbers), two floats (numbers with decimals), two matrices, any combination of these etc. Each of these different behaviors is a different method of the * function.",

    "section": "Data Types and Structures",
    "text": "Data Types and Structures\nThere are a number of different data types and structures in Julia. Here are the key ones for your to be aware of.\nData Types:\n\nInteger\n\nWhole numbers\n\nFloat\n\nNumbers with decimals\n\nBoolean\n\ntrue or false (written in lowercase)\n\ntrue has equal value to 1 e.g. 1 == true\nfalse has equal value to 0 e.g. 0 == false\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn Julia, the == operator is used to check if two values are equal. It returns a boolean value, true or false, depending on whether the values are equal or not i.e. 1 == true returns true because 1 and true are equal! It is different to the = operator, which is used to assign a value to a variable (see this section below for more details on variables).\nIn Julia there is also the === operator, which is used to check if two values are identical. This is different to the == operator, which checks if two values are equal. For example, 1 == true returns true because 1 and true are equal, but 1 === true returns false because 1 and true are not identical (they are not stored in the same location in memory in the computer).\n\n\n\nChar\n\nA single character e.g. \"H\"\n\nString\n\nA sequence of characters e.g. \"Hello World!\"\n\n\nData Structures:\n\nArray\n\nAn array is a collection of values that are all the same type. Arrays can be one-dimensional (vectors), two-dimensional (matrices), or multi-dimensional. Arrays are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they are created. An example of an array is [1, 2, 3]\n\nDataFrame\n\nA DataFrame is a special type of array created by the {DataFrames} package that is used to store tabular data. It is a collection of columns, where each column is an array of the same type.DataFrames are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they are created.\n\nTuple\n\nA tuple is a collection of values that do not all have to be the same type. Tuples are very useful because they require very little memory, so are fast to create and access. They are also immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed after they are created, but because they are so fast to create, you can just create a new tuple with the values you want. An example of a tuple is (\"John\", 25, 1.8)\n\nDictionary\n\nA dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs that do not need to be of the same type. Dictionaries are mutable, and are very useful for storing data that you want to access by a key (i.e. name), rather than an index. For example, you might want to store a person’s name, age, and height e.g. Dict(\"name\" =&gt; \"John\", \"age\" =&gt; 25, \"height\" =&gt; 1.8)\n\nNamed Tuple\n\nA variant of the tuple is the named tuple. It is a cross between a tuple and a dictionary, and therefore has the benefits of being able to access values with keys instead of indices (though you use indices), but it is immutable and much smaller and faster than a dictionary. For our person example, a named tuple would look like (name = \"John\", age = 25, height = 1.8)\n\nStructs\n\nA struct is a custom data type that you can create to store data. It is similar to a named tuple in that it is immutable and you can access values with keys instead of indices. One reason you may prefer to use a struct over a named tuple is that you can define methods for a struct (see the multiple dispatch section for more details). Creating structs are out of the scope of this book, but it is important to know that they exist and are a useful tool for organizing your data. If you want to learn more about structs, check out the documentation and this tutorial.\n\n\nIf you have an object and want to tell what type it is, you can use the typeof() function. If you have an array and want to tell what type the elements of the array are, you can use the eltype() function.",

    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nVariables really just stored pieces of information that you’ve given a name to. This is useful because it allows you to run a calculation, for example, and then save it for use later on. That way you don’t need to run the calculation again, you can just pull the value out of storage! A slightly different example is if you have a constant value that you use multiple times in your code, e.g. the size of a population. Rather than typing out the value every time you need it, you can just store it in a variable and use the variable name instead. This not only saves you time and makes your code more readable, but also can reduce the chance of making a mistake (e.g. if you accidentally type the wrong value when copying it to a new calculation).\n\nAssignment\nNow we know what variables are, let’s look at how to create them. As mentioned earlier, we use the = operator to assign a value to a variable. For example, if we wanted to create a variable called x and assign it the value 1, we would write x = 1. But we aren’t just restricted to numbers, we can assign any type of value to a variable. This includes strings, arrays, tuples, dictionaries, and structs.\nEarlier, when talking about data structures, we used the example of a person’s name, age, and height. Let’s see how we can create tuples, dictionaries, and dataframes to store this information.\n\nusing DataFrames # We need to load the DataFrames package to create a DataFrame\n\njohn_tuple = (\"John\", 25, 1.8)\njohn_ntuple = (name = \"John\", age = 25, height = 1.8)\njohn_dict = Dict(\"name\" =&gt; \"John\", \"age\" =&gt; 25, \"height\" =&gt; 1.8)\njohn_df = DataFrame(name = \"John\", age = 25, height = 1.8);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen creating a dictionary, you can use the =&gt; operator to assign a value to a key. The key is always on the left, and the value is always on the right.\nAt the end of the test array assignment, we have a semicolon (;). This has nothing to do with the array, but is used to suppress the output of the assignment, so when we run the code, we don’t see the array printed to the screen.\n\n\nBecause a person’s name is a string, their age is an integer, and their height is a float, we cannot create an array to store this information, because arrays can only store values of the same type. To show how we can create and access arrays, let’s create a vector (1-D array) of multiple people’s names, as well as a random matrix (2-D array).\n\npeople_vec = [\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Joe\"]\ntest_arr = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]\n\n3×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2  3\n 4  5  6\n 7  8  9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen creating a matrix, you can use a semi-colon to separate rows in the matrix. One alternative is to specify the exact positions of each value e.g.\ntest_arr = [\n    1 2 3\n    4 5 6\n    7 8 9\n]\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Values\nTo access the value stored in a variable, we can often use indices. Julia, like R, is a 1-indexed language, meaning that the first element in an array has an index of 1, not 0 (like Python). In our examples, the first element of the objects we created is the person’s name, so we can access it with an index of 1.\n\njohn_tuple[1] # \"John\"\njohn_ntuple[1] # \"John\"\npeople_vec[1]\n\n\"John\"\n\n\nFor dataframes and multi-dimensional arrays, we have to make a slight modification to use a comma that separates the indices for each dimension. In an array/dataframe, the first index is the row number, and the second index is the column number. To access the element in the first row and the first column of the array, we would use the following code.\n\ntest_arr[1, 1]\njohn_df[1, 1]\n\n\"John\"\n\n\nIf we want to access an entire row or column, we can use the : operator. For example, if we want to access the first column of the array, we can use the following code.\n\ntest_arr[:, 1]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 4\n 7\n\n\n\njohn_df[:, 1]\n\n1-element Vector{String}:\n \"John\"\n\n\nIf we want to access the first row of the array, we can use the following code.\n\ntest_arr[1, :]\n\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn all cases where we used the : operator, we get a column vector as the output, not a single value, regardless of whether we are extracting a row or a column from the original array!\n\n\nHowever, none of these methods work for dictionaries. For dictionaries, you need to specify the key of the value you want to access.\n\njohn_dict[\"name\"]\n\n\"John\"\n\n\nYou can also use the key (or column name) to access the value in dataframes and named tuples.\n\njohn_df[1, :name] # The : operator before the column name turns it into a symbol that can be used to index the dataframe\njohn_df[1, \"name\"]\n\njohn_ntuple.name\n\n\"John\"",

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\n\nOverview\nFunctions are a core part of programming in Julia, and programming in general. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. As has been said before, a function is like a recipe you might use to bake a cake. The recipe tells you what ingredients you need, how to combine them, and how long to bake them for. And like a recipe, a function can be used over and over again to produce the same result (assuming you have identical inputs). This is a really powerful concept, and helps make your work and research reproducible by breaking up your code into small, reusable, and understandable chunks. And because it is meant to be reused, it will save you time in cases when you need to do the same thing multiple times (you don’t want to have to write the same code over and over again)!\nSo let’s look at a simple example of a function in Julia, and use it to explore some of the key concepts of functions.\nSay we want to take a number, multiply it by 2, and then divide the result by 3. You could just write this out explicitly, but what if you want to do this for a bunch of different numbers? This is where a function comes in handy.\n\nfunction multiply_by_two_divide_by_three(x)\n    y = x * 2\n    z = y / 3\n    return z # it's good practice to explicitly return a value (or nothing in special cases)\nend\n\nmultiply_by_two_divide_by_three (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis function takes a single argument, x, and then multiplies it by 2 and divides it by 3. The return keyword tells Julia what value to return from the function. It also tells Julia that the function is finished, and it will not execute any code after the return statement.\nLet’s try using this function.\n\nmultiply_by_two_divide_by_three(3)\n\n2.0\n\n\n\nmultiply_by_two_divide_by_three(10)\n\n6.666666666666667\n\n\nNote that in both of these examples, a floating point number is returned i.e., a number with decimals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWithout going into too much detail, it is good practice to give functions short, descriptive names. A good example would be cumsum() that is provided in Julia and calculates the cumulative sum of a vector.\nIf a function name is too long to write without separating the words, use snake case (words separated by underscores) e.g. multiply_by_two_divide_by_three() rather than leaving as a single block of text (multiplybytwodividebythree()), or using camelCase (multiplyByTwoDivideByThree()).\nIt is also good practice to add a docstring to your function. This is a short description of what the function does, and can be accessed by typing ? followed by the function name in the REPL. This means that you can quickly understand exactly what a function does without having to work your way through the code, really helping others who may read your code, but also future you if you revisit a project.\nAn example of adding a docstring to a function may be as simple as adapting our original code to look like the following.\n\"\"\"\n    multiply_by_two_divide_by_three(x)\n\nMultiply `x` by 2 and divide by 3.\n\"\"\"\nfunction multiply_by_two_divide_by_three(x)\n    y = x * 2\n    z = y / 3\n    return z\nend\nRead more about docstrings here.\n\n\n\n\nArguments & Keyword Arguments\nUnlike R, Julia makes a distinction between arguments and keyword arguments. Arguments are the values that are passed to a function. In the example function above, x is an argument. In Julia, arguments are positional, meaning that the order in which you pass them to a function matters. To see this in practice, let’s write a new function that takes two arguments, x and y, and multiplies them together after minusing one from argument x and adding one to argument y.\n\nfunction multiply_together_offsets(x, y)\n    z = (x - 1) * (y + 1)\n    return z\nend\n\nmultiply_together_offsets (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBecause Julia uses positional arguments, the following two function calls will return different values, even though the numbers 5 and 10 are used in both.\n\nmultiply_together_offsets(5, 10)\n\n44\n\n\n\nmultiply_together_offsets(10, 5)\n\n54\n\n\nKeyword arguments are arguments that are passed to a function by name. Generally speaking, keyword arguments are used to set default values for arguments that can be changed by the user. Let’s modify our multiply_together_offsets function to use keyword arguments.\n\nfunction multiply_together_offsets(x, y; offset_x = 1, offset_y = 1)\n    z = (x - offset_x) * (y + offset_y)\n    return z\nend\n\nmultiply_together_offsets (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWe have added two new arguments to the function, offset_x and offset_y, and given them default values of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is not necessary, but it is generally good style to place keyword arguments after all positional arguments, as well as separating them from positional arguments using a semi-colon (;), rather than a comma.\n\n\nNow, when we call the function, we can specify the values of these arguments by name.\n\nmultiply_together_offsets(5, 10)\n\n44\n\n\n\nmultiply_together_offsets(5, 10; offset_x = 2, offset_y = 3)\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nScope\nScope is a relatively complicated concept, but it is important to understand it in order to write functions that are easy to understand and debug. Scope refers to the visibility of variables within a function. In Julia, variables that are defined within a function are not visible outside of the function. The reverse is not true, however. Variables that are defined outside of a function are visible within the function, but cannot be modified.\nLet’s look at some examples.\n\nfunction add_one(x)\n    y = x + 1\n    return y\nend\n\nadd_one(5)\n\n6\n\n\n\ny\n\nUndefVarError: UndefVarError(:y)\nUndefVarError: `y` not defined\n\n\nIn this case, y is defined within the function add_one() i.e. is a local variable, and is therefore not visible outside of the function, but it can be used within the function!\n\nglobal_x = 5\n\nfunction print_global_x()\n    return println(global_x)\nend\n\nprint_global_x()\n\n5\n\n\nIn this example, global_x is defined outside of the function print_global_x(), and is therefore visible within the function, but it cannot be modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt’s not good practice to access global variables in your functions. Instead, if you want to use a variable in your function, pass it as an argument.\n\n\n\nfunction modify_global_x()\n    global_x = 10\n    return global_x\nend\n\nmodify_global_x()\n\nglobal_x\n\n5\n\n\nHere, we have tried to modify global_x within the function modify_global_x(), but this has not worked. It looks like it worked when we called the function, but when we check the value of global_x outside of the function, it is still 5.\n\n\nMultiple Dispatch\nMultiple dispatch is the idea that the behavior of a function depends on the types of the arguments that are passed to it (as well as the number of arguments). To illustrate this, let’s go back to our original example function multiply_by_two_divide_by_three().\nIn the example above, we passed a single argument to the function, and it returned a floating point number. But what if we wanted to pass multiple numbers to the function, and have it return a vector of the results? We could do this by specifying another method of the function that accepts a tuple of numbers as an argument.\n\nfunction multiply_by_two_divide_by_three(x::Tuple)\n    y = zeros(Float64, length(x))\n    z = similar(y)\n\n    for i in eachindex(x)\n        y[i] = x[i] * 2\n        z[i] = y[i] / 3\n    end\n\n    return z\nend\n\nmultiply_by_two_divide_by_three (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nWe have defined a new method of the function (i.e., a new way of using the function) by specifying the type of the argument x as a tuple (::Tuple), and this is illustrated in the printout multiply_by_two_divide_by_three (generic function with 2 methods).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to understand exactly what the code is doing here (but have a look at the for loop section if you’re interested). Neither is the code particularly efficient, but it’s a relatively readable way to illustrate the concept of multiple dispatch.\n\n\nNow let’s test out our new function method\n\nmultiply_by_two_divide_by_three((1, 2, 3))\n\n3-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.6666666666666666\n 1.3333333333333333\n 2.0\n\n\nAnd we can see that the original method that just takes a single number as an argument still works.\n\nmultiply_by_two_divide_by_three(3)\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that keyword arguments are not considered in multiple dispatch i.e., trying to define a new method of a function that differs only by keyword arguments will not create a new method, but just overwrite the old one. So if you want/need a new method, use positional arguments.",

At their core, a package is a way for someone to share code, data, and documentation with other people. By design, Julia can’t do everything for everyone straight out of the box. Not only would it be an impossible task for the Julia developers to create a language that can do everything, but it would also be incredibly slow to load and run. Instead, packages extend the abilities of Julia by providing additional features (through functions) that are not included in the base language.\nThe {DataFrames} package, for example, creates a special data structure that is very easy to read, as well as providing a number of functions that make it easy to manipulate and analyze data.\nTo add a package to your Julia environment (project), you can use the add command in the package manager (accessed by pressing ] in the REPL). Then, you can use the using command to load the package into your current Julia session. See this page for more information in the context of setting up a new project.",

    "section": "Control Flow",
    "text": "Control Flow\nControl flow refers to the order in which the statements in a program are executed. There are many different ways to control how a program is executed, but we will focus on the most common ones here. See the Julia documentation for more information.\n\nIf Statements\nIf statements are a way to control whether or not a block of code is executed, and fall under the general category of conditional evaluation (but I think “if statements” gives you a more intuitive sense of what we’re talking about in this section). There are many uses for conditional evaluation, so we’ll just show you some examples of how to use it, and you can explore further if you need to. The following is an example from the Julia documentation.\n\nfunction number_relations(x, y)\n    if x &lt; y\n        relation = \"less than\"\n    elseif x == y\n        relation = \"equal to\"\n    else\n        relation = \"greater than\"\n    end\n    return println(\"x is \", relation, \" y.\")\nend\n\nnumber_relations(2, 1)\n\nx is greater than y.\n\n\nIn this example we are using an if statement to determine the relationship between two numbers. It’s important to note that the conditional statements are evaluated in sequence, and the first one that evaluates to true is executed i.e. if then elseif then else in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nelseif and else statements are both optional (i.e. just an if statement is valid), and you can have as many elseif statements as you like (including 0 i.e. just if and else statements).\n\n\n\nShort-Circuit Evaluation\nIf you want to check multiple conditions, you can use the && (and) and || (or) operators. These is known as short-circuit evaluation. For example, if we wanted to check if a number is between 0 and 10, we could do the following.\n\nfunction number_between(x)\n    if x &gt; 0 && x &lt; 10\n        println(\"x is between 0 and 10\")\n    else\n        println(\"x is not between 0 and 10\")\n    end\nend\n\nnumber_between(3)\n\nx is between 0 and 10\n\n\n\nnumber_between(11)\n\nx is not between 0 and 10\n\n\nIn number_between(3), x is greater than 0 and less than 10, so both conditions evaluate to true, and the code in the if statement is executed. In number_between(11), x is greater than 0, but not less than 10, so while the first condition evaluates to true, the second condition evaluates to false, so the code in the else statement is executed. This is important to understand - all conditions must evaluate to true for the code in the if statement to be executed! Based on this, try to think about why the following code also works.\n\nfunction number_between2(x)\n    if x &gt; 0 && ((x &gt; 10) == false)\n        println(\"x is between 0 and 10\")\n    else\n        println(\"x is not between 0 and 10\")\n    end\nend\n\nnumber_between2(3)\n\nx is between 0 and 10\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration\nIteration is a useful concept in programming, is a pretty intuitive way to think about many problems we come across in epidemiology (once you get used to it), and is very fast in Julia, so it’s worth spending some time to understand it. Do not expect to understand everything about iteration after reading this section, and you will likely need to come back to refer to it as you go through the book, but hopefully it will provide a good starting point for you to explore further.\n\nFor Loop\nThe most common way to iterate in Julia is using a for loop. We have already seen a for loop in the multiple dispatch section, but let’s look at a simpler example.\nLet’s say we want to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 (cumulative sum) i.e. 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 10. Julia has an in-built function to do this (cumsum()), but let’s write our own function to do it using a for loop.\nThere are multiple ways we could write this function, but the most intuitive way is to go through each of the numbers in 1 to 10, and add them to a running total.\n\nfunction mycumsum(x)\n    y = 0 # Initialize our running total to 0\n\n    # For each number in x, add it to our running total\n    for i in x\n        y += x[i] # This is equivalent to y = y + x[i]\n    end\n\n    return y\nend\n\nmycumsum(1:10)\n\n55\n\n\n\n\nWhile Loop\nAnother way to iterate is using a while loop. The difference between a for loop and a while loop is that a for loop iterates over a sequence of values, whereas a while loop iterates until a condition is met. For example, let’s say we want to keep adding numbers to our running total until the total is greater than 100 (and stop counting). We might not know how many numbers we need to add to get to 100, so we can’t use a for loop, but we can use a while loop.\n\nfunction mycumsum2(x)\n    y = 0 # Initialize our running total to 0\n    i = 1 # Initialize our counter to 1\n\n    # While our running total is less than 100, add the next number to our running total\n    while y &lt; 100\n        y += x[i] # This is equivalent to y = y + x[i]\n        i += 1 # Update our counter so we can add the next number\n    end\n\n    return println(\"We added \", i, \" numbers to get to \", y)\nend\n\nmycumsum2(1:100)\n\nWe added 15 numbers to get to 105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nwhile loops are very useful in many situations, but are more dangerous than for loops, because it’s easy to get stuck in an infinite loop. For example, if we accidentally started our cumulative sum between 0:100 and forgot to update our counter, we would never reach our condition of y &lt; 100, and the loop would never end. To avoid this, people often add break statements to their while loops, which will break out of the loop if a certain condition is met i.e. if we added 100 numbers and still haven’t reached 100, we can early exit out of the loop. Generally speaking, use a for loop if you can, and be careful when using while loops.",

    "text": "Miscellaneous\n\nDrWatson Project Structure\nIt may not be immediately obvious why we need to use DrWatson to create our Julia projects. In fact, we don’t need to use DrWatson to create our Julia projects, but it does make our lives a lot easier as it provides a consistent project structure that is easy to navigate.\nFirstly, it creates the following folders in your project folder (copied from the DrWatson documentation):\n│projectdir          &lt;- Project's main folder. It is initialized as a Git\n│                       repository with a reasonable .gitignore file.\n│\n├── _research        &lt;- WIP scripts, code, notes, comments,\n│   |                   to-dos and anything in an alpha state.\n│   └── tmp          &lt;- Temporary data folder.\n│\n├── data             &lt;- **Immutable and add-only!**\n��   ├── sims         &lt;- Data resulting directly from simulations.\n│   ├── exp_pro      &lt;- Data from processing experiments.\n│   └── exp_raw      &lt;- Raw experimental data.\n│\n├── plots            &lt;- Self-explanatory.\n├── notebooks        &lt;- Jupyter, Weave or any other mixed media notebooks.\n│\n├── papers           &lt;- Scientific papers resulting from the project.\n│\n├── scripts          &lt;- Various scripts, e.g. simulations, plotting, analysis,\n│   │                   The scripts use the `src` folder for their base code.\n│   └── intro.jl     &lt;- Simple file that uses DrWatson and uses its greeting.\n│\n├── src              &lt;- Source code for use in this project. Contains functions,\n│                       structures and modules that are used throughout\n│                       the project and in multiple scripts.\n│\n├── README.md        &lt;- Optional top-level README for anyone using this project.\n├── .gitignore       &lt;- by default ignores _research, data, plots, videos,\n│                       notebooks and latex-compilation related files.\n│\n├── Manifest.toml    &lt;- Contains full list of exact package versions used currently.\n└── Project.toml     &lt;- Main project file, allows activation and installation.\n                        Includes DrWatson by default.\nAbove providing us with a useful project structure, DrWatson also provides us with a number of very helpful functions.\nFor one, it provides us with the quickactivate() function that allows us to activate our project and environment when we’re working in a script, so we can easily import all the packages we need, regardless of where the script is saved. This means that we don’t need to worry about activating our project in the REPL before we start working in a script. This may not sound meaningful, but it’s very easy to forget to activate your project in the REPL before you start working in a script, and then you end up with a bunch of errors because you haven’t actually imported the packages you need. To use this, make sure your first two lines of your script are always:\nusing DrWatson\nquickactivate(\"MyFirstProject\")\nAnd secondly, it provides us with convenient directory paths to the folders in our project. For example, if we want to access the data folder in our project, we can use the datadir() function, which will return the path to the data folder. Similarly, if we wanted to save a plot to the plots folder, we could use save(plotsdir(\"plot_object.png\"), plot_object) function to save the plot in plot_object to the plots folder.\nMore details about the DrWatson project structure and associated functions can be found here.\n\n\nNaming Files\nWhen naming files and folders, it is important to be consistent and descriptive. Ideally the name will contain no spaces, and you can use dashes to separate words. See this presentation by Jenny Bryan for more information on naming files and folders, but in short:\n\nKISS (Keep It Simple Stupid): use simple and consistent file names\n\nIt needs to be machine readable\nIt needs to be human readable\nIt needs to order well in a directory\nNo special characters and no spaces!\n\nUse YYYY-MM-DD date format\nUse - to delimit words and _ to delimit sections\n\ni.e. 2019-01-19_my-data.csv\n\nLeft-pad numbers\n\ni.e. 01_my-data.csv vs 1_my-data.csv\nIf you don’t, file orders get messed up when you get to double-digits",

It’s a general purpose language, meaning that it can be used for pretty much anything, but it’s particularly well suited for scientific computing, and is often compared to R, Python, and Matlab. There are plenty of reasons why you might want to learn Julia, but the main ones are that it’s fast, easy to learn (as far as coding goes), and has a great community.

    "text": "File Paths\nIf you’ve set up your project using {DrWatson}, you should have a number of useful helper functions for you to use in your project (after loading and activating the project with using DrWatson; quickactivate(Project)). Because you created a new folder for the project, Julia will create a Project.toml and a Manifest.toml file in your project folder. This does all the hard work of setting up relative paths, and making sure each project has it’s own list of packages and versions, avoiding any conflicts that may arise when you set up another project with similar packages. To make use of your code and project-specific packages, you simply need to activate the project using {DrWatson}’s quickactivate(\"Project\") function (or with ]activate . if you are in the correct directory).\nA relative filepath is simply the steps that need to be taken to find your target file from the current location, e.g., the active file. For example, you may have the following files in a project:\n│projectdir\n│\n├── data\n│   └── exp_raw.csv\n├── out\n│   └── exp_clean.parquet\n.\n.\n.\n├── scripts\n│   ├── cleaning.jl\n│   └── intro.jl\n.\n.\n.\n├── Manifest.toml\n└── Project.toml\nThe relative filepath of the exp_raw.csv data file from the intro.jl scripts file is ../data/exp_raw.csv. Here, ../ means look in the parent directory i.e., one directory up from the current location, with the rest pointing to the data/ directory and appropriate file. If you wanted to cleaning.jl file from intro.jl, the relative path would just be cleaning.jl (or alternatively ./cleaning.jl, where ./ means look in the current directory).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGenerally you won’t need to refer to other script/ files as they shouldn’t contain functions that are used for calculations, only the scripts that utilize the functions defined in the src/ directory to produce your results. As we’ll come to later, Julia has been designed to make creating and working with packages very simple, which we will take full advantage to minimize the risk of files relying on each other in a circular fashion.\n\n\nAs mentioned, {DrWatson} provides convenience functions to simplify the process of locating files with relative paths. To load a file from the data/ folder, we need to include() it. This effectively finds the file and runs it, so everything defined in it is now available for use. In practice, we can simply use the command include(DrWatson.datadir(\"filename.jl\")) (or drop the DrWatson. package namespace if you brought {DrWatson} into the Main namespace with the using command - see here for more information about namespaces). This helpful function means that the file filename.jl can be loaded from within any file in your project without needing to use multiple ../ calls in the relative path, or specify the absolute filepath. It also means that you can send your code to the REPL and it will execute correctly, which is not a given as the directory that the REPL is started in is usually the project directory, and your current file may be in a subdirectory, so the relative paths to the file to load will be different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn case you’re wondering what {DrWatson} is doing when it sets up these helper scripts, we can just have a look at the source code. The beauty of Julia is that its speed and expressiveness means that most Julia packages are written in pure Julia and don’t need to resort to lower-level languages for the internals!\nLooking at these lines in the source code, we can see that the projectdir() function is effectively a wrapper around the below code, with a check to make sure you have activated the project.\n\ndirname(Base.active_project())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBecause we created the out/ directory to save our processed data files to, it would be useful to have a similar helper function to {DrWatson}’s. We can do that very easily using the following function definition:\n\noutdir(args...) = DrWatson.projectdir(\"outdir\", args...)\n\nIncidentally, this is exactly how {DrWatson} defines it’s helper functions, and states that the functions can take any number of arguments and should join the directory path of the outdir/ and the function arguments. For example, outdir(\"simulation-files\") becomes path-to-project/outdir/simulation-files/.",

If you wish to use the values from the file, rather than just viewing them, you should assign them to a variable e.g. raw_df = read_csv(DrWatson.datadir(\"exp_raw.csv\")).\nWriting data to files is similarly simple, just replacing the read_ with write_, and passing in a DataFrame as the first argument. For example, to write a dataframe to a csv file, you simply use the command write_csv(raw_df, outdir(\"exp_clean.csv\")). Currently, all write functions require the use of a DataFrame object, and all read functions return a DataFrame object.",

    "text": "Import-Specific Options\n\nSpecific Excel Sheets & Ranges\nWhile it’s generally preferable to try and use non-proprietary data files that can be read by multiple software tools, such as .csv files, we are sometimes just provided with Excel files (or need to create them). In these situations, we can use {TidierFiles}‘s Excel functions’ to access data from specific sheets, or use the underlying {XLSX} package to read and write Excel files.\nTo read data from a sheet, we use the sheet = keyword argument of read_xlsx(path-to-file.xlsx, sheet = \"sheet-name\") function.\nOften, Excel sheets contain multiple tables, which may be related to one-another, but should be considered as their own separate entities. In these situations we can use the range = keyword argument of the read_xlsx function to only read a portion of the Excel sheet.\n\n\nMissing Data\nFor delimited and Excel files, it is possible to specify how missing data should be handled on file reads. This is done using the missingstring = keyword argument of the read_{format} functions, and defaults to \"\".\n\n\nSkipping Rows\nYour input data files may include a number of header rows that you do not want to include in the resulting dataframes, for example, a data dictionary that lists how values in the main table are coded. These rows can be skipped using the skip = keyword argument of all the read_{format} functions.",

    "text": "Export-Specific Options\n\nSpecific Excel Sheets\nIf we want to write data to a specific sheet, we cannot use the {TidierFiles} excel functions. More information on how this can be accomplished can be found at the documentation of the {XLSX} package, but in brief, you must open up an excel file in either w (write) or rw (read-write) mode, depending on whether the file already exists, before setting the sheet’s values equal to the data you wish to add to the sheet.\nAn example of creating a new spreadsheet can from the documentation is shown below:\n\nXLSX.openxlsx(\"my_new_file.xlsx\", mode=\"w\") do xf\n    sheet = xf[1]\n    XLSX.rename!(sheet, \"new_sheet\")\n    sheet[\"A1\"] = \"this\"\n    sheet[\"A2\"] = \"is a\"\n    sheet[\"A3\"] = \"new file\"\n    sheet[\"A4\"] = 100\n\n    # will add a row from \"A5\" to \"E5\"\n    sheet[\"A5\"] = collect(1:5) # equivalent to `sheet[\"A5\", dim=2] = collect(1:4)`\n\n    # will add a column from \"B1\" to \"B4\"\n    sheet[\"B1\", dim=1] = collect(1:4)\n\n    # will add a matrix from \"A7\" to \"C9\"\n    sheet[\"A7:C9\"] = [ 1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ; 7 8 9 ]\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are not already familiar with do blocks, don’t worry, they are relatively simple. The Excel file is being created and assigned to the xf variable, which can then be manipulated with an anonymous function that has its own scope. You can use the do block when using the map function, as shown earlier.",
