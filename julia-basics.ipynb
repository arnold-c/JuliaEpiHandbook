        "# Julia Basics {.unnumbered}\n",
        "## Key Terms\n",
        "\n",
        "- **REPL**: The Julia REPL is the Julia Read-Eval-Print-Loop.\n",
        "    This is the interactive command line interface for Julia.\n",
        "    When you start Julia in the command line (terminal in Mac/Linux, command prompt in Windows), you are in the REPL, and it is a common way to interact with Julia.\n",
        "- **Package**: A package is a collection of code that can be used to extend the functionality of Julia and complete specific tasks.\n",
        "    Packages are installed using the `Pkg` package manager.\n",
        "- **Variable**: A variable is a value or object that you have assigned a name.\n",
        "    This may be as simple as a number or a sentence (a string variable), or as complex as a model or a plot.\n",
        "- **Function**: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
        "    Functions are called by name and can take arguments, before completing some computation and returning a value or object.\n",
        "    Sometimes functions are written and called for their side effects, i.e. they do not directly return an object, but instead perform some action.\n",
        "- **Method**: A method is a specific implementation of a function.\n",
        "- **Multiple Dispatch**: Multiple dispatch is a really exciting feature of Julia, but also one that is more difficult to understand for newer programmers.\n",
        "    The basic premise is that in Julia, how functions behave depends on the types of the arguments that are passed to them.\n",
        "    For example, the `*` operator (function) will behave differently if you try to multiply two integers (whole numbers), two floats (numbers with decimals), two matrices, any combination of these etc.\n",
        "    Each of these different behaviors is a different **method** of the `*` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What to Expect\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned previously, this book (and page) is not meant to provide a ground-up description of everything you need to know about Julia.\n",
        "Instead, we'll give an overview of some of the key concepts and features that should provide enough of an understanding that you can start using Julia with reasonable confidence.\n",
        "It'll likely take a couple of passes through this page to really get a good understanding of the concepts, and that's okay!\n",
        "It's meant to act as a reference so you can come back to it later if you don't understand something in the later, more-applied, sections.\n",
        "At the bottom of this page are some additional resources that you can use to gain a deeper understanding of Julia.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Types and Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of different data types and structures in Julia.\n",
        "Here are the key ones for your to be aware of.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Types**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Integer**\n",
        "  - Whole numbers\n",
        "- **Float**\n",
        "  - Numbers with decimals\n",
        "- **Boolean**\n",
        "  - `true` or `false` (written in lowercase)\n",
        "    - `true` has equal value to `1` e.g. `1 == true`\n",
        "    - `false` has equal value to `0` e.g. `0 == false`\n",
        "\n",
        "::: {.callout-note}\n",
        "\n",
        "In Julia, the `==` operator is used to check if two values are equal.\n",
        "It returns a boolean value, `true` or `false`, depending on whether the values are equal or not i.e. `1 == true` returns `true` because `1` and `true` are equal!\n",
        "It is different to the `=` operator, which is used to assign a value to a variable (see [this section below](#assignment) for more details on variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "In Julia there is also the `===` operator, which is used to check if two values are identical.\n",
        "This is different to the `==` operator, which checks if two values are equal.\n",
        "For example, `1 == true` returns `true` because `1` and `true` are equal, but `1 === true` returns `false` because `1` and `true` are not identical (they are not stored in the same location in memory in the computer).\n",
        "\n",
        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Char**\n",
        "  - A single character e.g. `\"H\"`\n",
        "- **String**\n",
        "    - A sequence of characters e.g. `\"Hello World!\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Structures**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Array**\n",
        "  - An **array** is a collection of values that are all the same type.\n",
        "  Arrays can be one-dimensional (**vectors**), two-dimensional (**matrices**), or multi-dimensional.\n",
        "  Arrays are **mutable**, meaning that they can be changed after they are created.\n",
        "  An example of an array is `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
        "- **DataFrame**\n",
        "  - A **DataFrame** is a special type of **array** created by the `{DataFrames}` package that is used to store tabular data.\n",
        "  It is a collection of columns, where each column is an **array** of the same type.**DataFrames** are **mutable**, meaning that they can be changed after they are created.\n",
        "- **Tuple**\n",
        "  - A **tuple** is a collection of values that do not all have to be the same type.\n",
        "  **Tuples** are very useful because they require very little memory, so are fast to create and access.\n",
        "  They are also **immutable**, meaning that they cannot be changed after they are created, but because they are so fast to create, you can just create a new tuple with the values you want.\n",
        "  An example of a **tuple** is `(\"John\", 25, 1.8)`\n",
        "- **Dictionary**\n",
        "  - A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs that do not need to be of the same type.\n",
        "    **Dictionaries** are **mutable**, and are very useful for storing data that you want to access by a key (i.e. name), rather than an index.\n",
        "    For example, you might want to store a person's name, age, and height e.g. `Dict(\"name\" => \"John\", \"age\" => 25, \"height\" => 1.8)`\n",
        "- **Named Tuple**\n",
        "  - A variant of the **tuple** is the **named tuple**.\n",
        "  It is a cross between a **tuple** and a **dictionary**, and therefore has the benefits of being able to access values with keys instead of indices (though you use indices), but it is **immutable** and much smaller and faster than a **dictionary**.\n",
        "  For our person example, a **named tuple** would look like `(name = \"John\", age = 25, height = 1.8)`\n",
        "- **Structs**\n",
        "  - A **struct** is a custom data type that you can create to store data.\n",
        "  It is similar to a **named tuple** in that it is **immutable** and you can access values with keys instead of indices.\n",
        "  One reason you may prefer to use a **struct** over a **named tuple** is that you can define methods for a **struct** (see [the multiple dispatch section](#multiple-dispatch) for more details).\n",
        "  Creating **structs** are out of the scope of this book, but it is important to know that they exist and are a useful tool for organizing your data.\n",
        "  If you want to learn more about **structs**, check out the [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Composite-Types) and [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHQe3PiYY1w).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have an object and want to tell what type it is, you can use the `typeof()` function.\n",
        "If you have an array and want to tell what type the elements of the array are, you can use the `eltype()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables really just stored pieces of information that you've given a name to.\n",
        "This is useful because it allows you to run a calculation, for example, and then save it for use later on.\n",
        "That way you don't need to run the calculation again, you can just pull the value out of storage!\n",
        "A slightly different example is if you have a constant value that you use multiple times in your code, e.g. the size of a population.\n",
        "Rather than typing out the value every time you need it, you can just store it in a variable and use the variable name instead.\n",
        "This not only saves you time and makes your code more readable, but also can reduce the chance of making a mistake (e.g. if you accidentally type the wrong value when copying it to a new calculation).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we know what **variables** are, let's look at how to create them.\n",
        "As mentioned earlier, we use the `=` operator to assign a value to a **variable**.\n",
        "For example, if we wanted to create a variable called `x` and assign it the value `1`, we would write `x = 1`.\n",
        "But we aren't just restricted to numbers, we can assign any type of value to a variable.\n",
        "This includes **strings**, **arrays**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **structs**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Earlier, when talking about data structures, we used the example of a person's name, age, and height.\n",
        "Let's see how we can create **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **dataframes** to store this information.\n"

        "And like a recipe, a function can be used over and over again to produce the same result (assuming you have identical inputs).\n",
